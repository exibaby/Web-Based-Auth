# Web-Based-Auth
This is a simple web based auth system that can run off any paste website, a few examples include pastebin.com and rentry.co. I do not recommend this for large projects as it is NOT secure unless protected.

This auth system contains discord webhook logs, so you can see who is using your program.

Logged Identifiers include:

- Discord ID
- License Type
- Hardware ID
- Time
- Date
